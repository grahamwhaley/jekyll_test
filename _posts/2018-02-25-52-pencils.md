# 52 pencils - a pencil based blog

What is '52 pencils'? Well, the idea is to blog (for want of a better word)
about a different pencil every week, for a year.

Why? Well, I like pencils, and I have quite a few. I currently semi-randomly cycle my way
through a few whilst working, and occasionally I'll splash out and grab some new ones that
I don't already have. I'd sort of like to try them all, all the ones I own, and one way
to do that in some sort of ordered manner is, well, do one a week.

But why blog? Well, just a couple of the pencils I have might be fairly unique or rare enough
that it would be nice if I got what little info I have out there. And I'd like to have a record
for myself, and share just in case one day somebody else finds something useful.

As I go along hopefully I can dig up and record some info about the pencils and their manufacturers...
we'll see.

First pencil?, will be a Mitsubishi 9800 HB.
